# Variables REST API – Getting started

The Variables REST API provides endpoints to query, create, update, and delete variables in Figma files.[page:1] Variables store reusable values that can be applied to design properties and prototyping actions.[page:1]

You can use this API to:

- Integrate Figma with continuous integration (CI) systems.[page:1]
- Sync your design system source of truth to and from Figma (for example, via the public FigJam guide file).[page:1]

If you update variables in a Figma file using the API, you must **publish the variables** before they can be used in other files.[page:1] Variables endpoints can be combined with the Plugin API for additional workflows.[page:1]

The API is limited to users with a **Full seat in an Enterprise organization**; guests cannot call these endpoints.[page:1]

## Requirements

The following table summarizes plan, account, file permissions, and scopes needed.[page:1]

| Method | Plan       | Account type           | File permissions | Token scopes             |
|--------|------------|------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| `GET`  | Enterprise | Any organization member | View access      | `file_variables:read`    |
| `POST` | Enterprise | Full seats, admins     | Edit access      | `file_variables:write`   |[page:1]
