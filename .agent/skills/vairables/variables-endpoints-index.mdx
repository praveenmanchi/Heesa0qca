# Variables REST API – Endpoints

The Variables REST API exposes three main endpoints.[page:2]

- **GET local variables** – Fetch local variables in a file and remote variables used in that file.[page:2]
- **GET published variables** – Fetch variables published from a given file.[page:2]
- **POST variables** – Bulk create, update, and delete local variables and variable collections.[page:2]

Each endpoint has different scopes, rate‑limit tiers, and response shapes described below and in their dedicated sections.[page:2]
