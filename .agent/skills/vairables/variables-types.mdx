# Variables – Types

Variables in Figma have preset types (string, boolean, float, color), belong to a variable collection, and hold different values for each mode in that collection.[page:3] Design node properties can bind to variables so that values respond to variable changes or mode switches.[page:3]

Extended collections let you create variants of existing collections with custom override values while still inheriting all variables and modes from a parent collection.[page:3] This is particularly useful for themes, regional variants, or brand variations.[page:3]

Key properties of extended collections include:[page:3]

- Inheritance of all variables from the parent collection.[page:3]
- Ability to override any inherited variable value per mode.[page:3]
- Encoded extended mode IDs that carry both collection ID and mode ID, e.g. `VariableCollectionId:1:2/3:4`.[page:3]
- Only **local** collections can be extended through the REST API, though local extensions of subscribed collections are supported.[page:3]

The types below are returned by `GET /v1/files/:file_key/variables/local` and `GET /v1/files/:file_key/variables/published`, with the published endpoint returning a subset.[page:3]

## `VariableCollection`

Represents a grouping of related variables sharing the same modes.[page:3]

Key properties:

- `id`, `name`, `key` – identifiers for the collection.[page:3]
- `modes` – map of `modeId` to mode metadata, including optional `parentModeId` for extended collections.[page:3]
- `defaultModeId` – ID of the default mode.[page:3]
- `remote` – whether the collection is remote.[page:3]
- `hiddenFromPublishing` – whether the collection is hidden when publishing the file as a library.[page:3]
- `variableIds` – IDs of variables within the collection (includes inherited and local for extended collections).[page:3]
- `isExtension` – whether this is an extended collection.[page:3]
- `parentVariableCollectionId` – ID of the collection being directly extended.[page:3]
- `rootVariableCollectionId` – ID of the original non‑extended collection in the extension chain.[page:3]
- `inheritedVariableIds` – IDs of the variables inherited from the parent.[page:3]
- `localVariableIds` – IDs of variables created directly in this extended collection.[page:3]
- `variableOverrides` – nested map of variable overrides by `variableId` and `modeId`.[page:3]

## `Variable`

A single design token with values for each mode.[page:3]

Key properties:

- `id`, `name`, `key` – identifiers for the variable.[page:3]
- `variableCollectionId` – collection that contains this variable.[page:3]
- `resolvedType` – `BOOLEAN`, `FLOAT`, `STRING`, or `COLOR`.[page:3]
- `valuesByMode` – map of `modeId` to primitive value, color, or `VariableAlias`.[page:3]
- `remote` – whether the variable is remote.[page:3]
- `description` – human‑readable description.[page:3]
- `hiddenFromPublishing` – whether the variable is hidden when publishing the file as a library.[page:3]
- `scopes` – array of `VariableScope` values controlling visibility in variable pickers in the UI.[page:3]
- `codeSyntax` – `VariableCodeSyntax` specifying platform‑specific names as surfaced in Dev Mode snippets.[page:3]
- `deletedButReferenced` – indicates the variable was deleted in the editor but still referenced in documents or aliases.[page:3]

## `VariableAlias`

Represents an alias to another variable.[page:3]

Properties:

- `type` – always `VARIABLE_ALIAS`.[page:3]
- `id` – ID of the target variable (may be a temporary ID when used in `POST variables`).[page:3]

## `VariableScope`

Controls where variables appear in the UI pickers.[page:3]

- Supported for `FLOAT` and `COLOR`, with different enums for each type.[page:3]
- `ALL_SCOPES` indicates that the variable is visible in all supported fields.[page:3]
- `ALL_FILLS` indicates visibility in all current and future fill fields for color variables.[page:3]

Example scopes:[page:3]

- FLOAT: `ALL_SCOPES`, `CORNER_RADIUS`, `WIDTH_HEIGHT`, `GAP`, `FONT_SIZE`, etc.[page:3]
- STRING: `ALL_SCOPES`, `TEXT_CONTENT`, `FONT_FAMILY`, etc.[page:3]
- COLOR: `ALL_SCOPES`, `ALL_FILLS`, `FRAME_FILL`, `TEXT_FILL`, `STROKE_COLOR`, etc.[page:3]

## `VariableCodeSyntax`

Platform‑specific code syntax definitions for a variable.[page:3]

This is a map keyed by platform:[page:3]

- `WEB`
- `ANDROID`
- `iOS`

Each entry defines how the variable should appear in code snippets for that platform.[page:3]
