It's good practice to make a plugin's UI consistent, to the degree that it is possible, with the rest of the Figma UI. This almost always leads to a better experience for users.

Figma does not maintain an official set of resuable components, but our [Plugin Samples repository](https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples?tab=readme-ov-file#other-figma-plugin-samples--starters) has links to community-developed frameworks, starter kits, and HTML/CSS samples.
