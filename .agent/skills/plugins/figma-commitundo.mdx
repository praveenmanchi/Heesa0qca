Commits actions to undo history. This does not trigger an undo.

### [commitUndo](/docs/plugins/api/properties/figma-commitundo/)(): void

## Remarks[​](#remarks "Direct link to Remarks")

By default, plugin actions are not committed to undo history. Call `figma.commitUndo()` so that triggered undos can revert a subset of plugin actions.

For example, after running the following plugin code, the first triggered undo will undo both the rectangle and the ellipse:

```
figma.createRectangle();figma.createEllipse();figma.closePlugin();
```

Whereas if we call `commitUndo()` in our plugin, the first triggered undo will only undo the ellipse:

```
figma.createRectangle();figma.commitUndo();figma.createEllipse();figma.closePlugin();
```
