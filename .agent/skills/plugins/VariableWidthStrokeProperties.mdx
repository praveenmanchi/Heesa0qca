For nodes using variable width strokes, [`node.variableWidthStrokeProperties`](/docs/plugins/api/node-properties/#variablewidthstrokeproperties) can be used to get and set the stroke's width profile. There are two types of variable width stroke properties: preset profiles and custom profiles.

```
type VariableWidthStrokeProperties =  | PresetVariableWidthStrokeProperties  | CustomVariableWidthStrokeProperties
```

### Preset Variable Width Stroke Properties[​](#preset-variable-width-stroke-properties "Direct link to Preset Variable Width Stroke Properties")

The available preset width profiles are:

Profile Name

Description

`UNIFORM`

Constant width

`WEDGE`

Tapers from the full width of the stroke to a single point

`TAPER`

Tapers from the full width of the stroke to 1/4 of the width

`QUARTER_TAPER`

Starts at 1/4 of the width of the stroke, grows to full width 1/4 of the way along the path, then shrinks to 1/4 of the width

`EYE`

Tapers to a point at both ends and is full width in center

`MIRRORED_TAPER`

Tapers from 1/4 of the width at both ends and is full width in the center

### widthProfile: 'UNIFORM' | 'WEDGE' | 'TAPER' | 'QUARTER\_TAPER' | 'EYE' | 'MIRRORED\_TAPER'

The width profile of the stroke.

### Custom Variable Width Stroke Properties[​](#custom-variable-width-stroke-properties "Direct link to Custom Variable Width Stroke Properties")

For nodes with a custom variable width stroke profile, the `variableWidthPoints` property defines an array of `VariableWidthPoint` objects and the `widthProfile` property is fixed to `'CUSTOM'`. Each `VariableWidthPoint` specifies a position along the stroke (from 0 to 1) and the width, as a fraction of the overall stroke weight, at that position.

#### Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

```
node.variableWidthStrokeProperties = {  widthProfile: 'CUSTOM',  variableWidthPoints: [    { position: 0, width: 0.5 },    { position: 0.2, width: 1 },    { position: 1, width: 0.5 },  ],}
```

### widthProfile: 'CUSTOM'

The width profile of the stroke. Fixed to 'CUSTOM'.

* * *

### variableWidthPoints: ReadonlyArray<[VariableWidthPoint](/docs/plugins/api/VariableWidthStrokeProperties/#variable-width-point)\>

An array of variable width points defining the custom width profile.

* * *

### VariableWidthPoint[​](#variablewidthpoint "Direct link to VariableWidthPoint")

### position: number

The position of the variable width point along the stroke, from 0 (the start of the stroke) to 1 (the end of the stroke).

* * *

### width: number

The width of the stroke at this variable width point as a fraction of the stroke weight.
