type TextListOptions = {    type: "ORDERED" | "UNORDERED" | "NONE"}
```

An object describing list settings for a range of text. The possible values for `type` are:

*   `"ORDERED"`: if the text range has been set to be part of an ordered list (ie: list with numerical counter).
*   `"UNORDERED"`: if the text range has been set to be part of an unordered list (ie: bulleted list).
*   `"NONE"`: if the text range is plain text and is not part of any list
