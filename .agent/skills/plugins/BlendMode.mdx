Blend mode describes how a color blends with what's underneath it. This property is typically set on a layer, fill or effect (e.g. blend mode of the shadow).

These blend modes are fairly standard and should match what you would find in other image processing tools. [\[Examples\]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/blend-mode)
