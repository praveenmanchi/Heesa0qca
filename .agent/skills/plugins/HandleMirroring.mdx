```
type HandleMirroring = "NONE" | "ANGLE" | "ANGLE_AND_LENGTH"
```

The possible values are:

*   `"NONE"`: the two vector handles are independent from each other
*   `"ANGLE"`: the two vector handles form a single tangent line, but the length of each handle is independent
*   `"ANGLE_AND_LENGTH"`: the two vector handles form a single tangent line, equidistant on both sides of the vertex
