# Components and styles – Types

These types describe metadata for **published** components, component sets, and styles in team libraries.[page:1] For local or subscribed assets, use the file endpoints instead of these library types.[page:1]

## Component

An individual published UI component that can be instantiated across files.[page:1]

Key properties:[page:1]

- `key`: unique identifier of the component.  
- `file_key`: key of the Figma file containing the component.  
- `node_id`: node ID of the component within the file.  
- `thumbnail_url`: URL to the component’s thumbnail image.  
- `name`: component name.  
- `description`: description entered by the publisher.  
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: UTC ISO‑8601 timestamps for creation and last update.  
- `user`: user who last updated the component (see user type).[page:1]
- `containing_frame`: optional frame info describing the frame that contains the component.[page:1]

## ComponentSet

A node representing a set of related component variants.[page:1]

Key properties:[page:1]

- `key`: unique identifier of the component set.  
- `file_key`: key of the file containing the set.  
- `node_id`: node ID of the component set in the file.  
- `thumbnail_url`: URL to the component set thumbnail.  
- `name`: component set name.  
- `description`: description entered by the publisher.  
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: creation and last update timestamps.  
- `user`: user who last updated the component set.  
- `containing_frame`: frame info if the set resides in a frame.[page:1]

## Style

A reusable set of properties that can be applied to nodes (e.g. color, text, effects, grids).[page:1]

Key properties:[page:1]

- `key`: unique identifier of the style.  
- `file_key`: key of the file containing the style.  
- `node_id`: node ID of the style in the file.  
- `style_type`: enum string: `FILL`, `TEXT`, `EFFECT`, or `GRID`.  
- `thumbnail_url`: URL to the style thumbnail.  
- `name`: style name.  
- `description`: description entered by the publisher.  
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: creation and last update timestamps.  
- `user`: user who last updated the style.  
- `containing_frame`: frame info if the style node resides in a frame.[page:1]

## FrameInfo

Metadata about the frame containing a component or style.[page:1]

Key properties:[page:1]

- `node_id`: frame node ID within the file.  
- `name`: frame name.  
- `backgroundColor`: frame background color.  
- `pageId`: ID of the page that contains the frame.  
- `pageName`: name of that page.  
- `containingComponentSet`: component set node containing the frame, if applicable (preferred over deprecated `containingStateGroup`).[page:1]
