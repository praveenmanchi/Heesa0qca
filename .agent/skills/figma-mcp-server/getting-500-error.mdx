This usually means something went wrong on the AI assistant side (Cursor, Claude Code, VSCode, etc.) - not the MCP server. It could be a temporary failure in the model request or a bug in the IDE.

**What to try:**

• Retry the request with a smaller selection or simpler prompt

• Restart the IDE or plugin

• Check the output/logs for clues about where it failed

• Report it through your IDE or assistant's support channel

If it keeps happening, share a screenshot or error message - we're happy to help investigate.
