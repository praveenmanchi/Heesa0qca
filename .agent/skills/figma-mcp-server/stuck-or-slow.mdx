Sometimes the request hangs, takes too long, or returns incomplete results. Most often, it's due to selection size:

*   **Selection is too large**
    
    Try selecting smaller sections or individual components (e.g. a card, header, sidebar). Large, deeply nested frames can overwhelm the context window and slow things down, or silently fail.
    
    For more details, see [5\. Avoid selecting large, heavy frames](/docs/figma-mcp-server/avoid-large-frames/)
    
*   **Local model timeout or confusion**
    
    If you see an error like **"lost connection to MCP server"**, that's coming from the **AI agent**. It likely timed out or misinterpreted the context. Retry with a smaller selection or clearer prompt.
    

> Note: Since the MCP server runs locally, it's not affected by traffic. Most slowdowns come from the size of the selection or how the model handles it.
