If the MCP server gave you some image URLs to use and now they're no longer working, it could be because they've expired.

When using the MCP server, we temporarily host your images to help you quickly test and validate your code is working as you expect. However, those links eventually and expire and your browser will be unable to load them using the same URL.

If this has happened, you have a couple of options.

## Getting new URLs[​](#getting-new-urls "Direct link to Getting new URLs")

You can provide a link to the same design you initially implemented and ask your AI agent to get the code for it again. This will provide your agent with fresh links to use. However, keep in mind that these will eventually expire again.

## Saving the assets[​](#saving-the-assets "Direct link to Saving the assets")

The best way to ensure your images are always available is to download them to your codebase and reference those local files instead.

You can either do this manually by visiting each URL and saving the files, or depending on your client, you can ask your AI agent to do this task for you and save it to the folder of your choice.
