Break screens into smaller parts (like components or logical chunks) for faster, more reliable results.

Large selections can slow the tools down, cause errors, or result in incomplete responses, especially when there's too much context for the model to process. Instead:

1.  Generate code for **smaller sections or individual components** (e.g. `Card`, `Header`, `Sidebar`)
2.  **If it feels slow or stuck, reduce your selection size and try again**

This helps keep the context manageable and results more predictable, both for you and for the model.

**The bottom line -**

If something in the output doesn't look quite right, it usually helps to revisit the basics: how the Figma file is structured, how the prompt is written, and what context is being sent. Following the best practices above can make a big difference, and often leads to more consistent, reusable code.
