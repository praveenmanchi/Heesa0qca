Components and styles endpoints allow several ways to get information about published components and styles in a team library. You can get a list of components or styles using a team\_id, or a specific component or style using a key.

## GET team components[​](#get-team-components-endpoint "Direct link to GET team components")

Get a paginated list of published components within a team library.

info

This is a [Tier 3 endpoint](/docs/rest-api/rate-limits/#rate-limits-tier-table) and requires the [`team_library_content:read` scope](/docs/rest-api/scopes/).

### HTTP Endpoint[​](#http-endpoint "Direct link to HTTP Endpoint")

`GET /v1/teams/:team_id/components`

**Return value**

```
{  "status": Number,  "error": Boolean,  "meta": {    "components": [      {       "key": String,       "file_key": String,       "node_id": String,       "thumbnail_url": String,       "name": String,       "description": String,       "updated_at": String,       "created_at": String,       "user": User,       "containing_frame": FrameInfo,      },      ...    ],    "cursor": {      "before": Number,      "after": Number,    },   },}
