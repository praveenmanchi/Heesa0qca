### Filtering[​](#filtering "Direct link to Filtering")

Add filters to your request using query string parameters. You can add combinations of path parameters to create specific queries. Here are a few examples:

*   Get the first 100 `org_user_create` and `org_user_delete` events from the last year
    
    ```
    curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' 'https://api.figma.com/v1/activity_logs?limit=100&events=org_user_create,org_user_delete'
    ```
    
*   Get all changes made to a person’s paid status for a product
    
    ```
    curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' 'https://api.figma.com/v1/activity_logs?events=org_user_account_type_change'
    ```
    
*   Get all the events between `2021-11-30 19:20:00 UTC` and `2021-12-01 23:06:40 UTC`
    
    ```
    curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' 'https://api.figma.com/v1/activity_logs?start_time=1638300000&end_time=1638400000'
    ```
    

## Pagination[​](#pagination "Direct link to Pagination")

The API sorts returned events by timestamp in ascending order by default. The max number of events the endpoint can return at a time is 1000 events. You can set a lower value using the `limit` parameter.

If the total number of events is higher than the limit, the API will paginate the response. The JSON response will contain `cursor` and `next_page: true`, fields. The cursor encodes the last event—the most recent event—in the response.

```
{  "error": false,  "i18n": null,  "meta": {    "activity_logs": [      …    ],    "cursor": "NjYzMDMxMjM5ODA4NjcvNDAwMDA=",    "next_page": true,  },  "status": 200}
```

To get the next batch of events, add the cursor parameter to your new query string.

```
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' 'https://api.figma.com/v1/activity_logs?cursor=NjYzMDMxMjM5ODA4NjcvNDAwMDA='
```

You'll likely poll this endpoint every few minutes to get the latest batch of events. You can append the `cursor` from the previous query to your new query. This will return any unseen events since your last query.
