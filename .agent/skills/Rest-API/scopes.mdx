Scopes for [personal access tokens](/docs/rest-api/authentication/#access-tokens) and [OAuth 2 tokens](/docs/rest-api/authentication/#oauth-apps) determine which endpoints can be accessed.

The following table lists the scopes that are available.

**Important**: Scopes do not supersede the permissions granted to you by an organization or the owner of a project, team, or file. You can only access files that you've created or that have been shared with you (whether shared directly, or because you belong to a corresponding project or team). Similarly, if you listed projects and teams, you'd only see the projects and teams that you can access in Figma's file browser.

Scope

Description

`current_user:read`

Read your name, email, and profile image.

`file_comments:read`

Read the comments for files.

`file_comments:write`

Post and delete comments and comment reactions in files.

`file_content:read`

Read the contents of files, such as nodes and the editor type.

`file_dev_resources:read`

Read dev resources in files.

`file_dev_resources:write`

Write dev resources to files.

`file_metadata:read`

Read metadata of files.

`file_variables:read`

Read variables in files. Note: Enterprise plan only.

`file_variables:write`

Write variables and collections in files. Note: Enterprise plan only.

`file_versions:read`

Read the version history for files you can access.

`files:read`

**Deprecated**. Read files, projects, users, versions, comments, components, styles, and webhooks. While this scope will continue to work, it's highly recommended you use the granular scopes Figma provides. Because `files:read` is extremely permissive, more limited scopes such as `file_content:read` and `file_comments:read` provide enhanced security and stability by reducing the surface of access to your files.

`library_analytics:read`

Read your design system analytics. Note: Enterprise plan only.

`library_assets:read`

Read data of individual published components and styles.

`library_content:read`

Read published components and styles of files.

`org:activity_log_read`

Read organization [activity logs](/docs/rest-api/activity-logs/). Note: Enterprise plan only. Must be an organization admin.

`org:discovery_read`

Read [text event data](/docs/rest-api/discovery/) in the organization. Note: Enterprise plans with Governance+ only. Must be an organization admin.

`projects:read`

List projects and files in projects.

`selections:read`

Read most recent selection in files you can access.

`team_library_content:read`

Read published components and styles of teams.

`webhooks:read`

Read metadata of webhooks.

`webhooks:write`

Create and manage webhooks.

note

**Note**: the `file_read` scope is deprecated for OAuth 2 tokens. Please migrate your application to use the scopes above.
