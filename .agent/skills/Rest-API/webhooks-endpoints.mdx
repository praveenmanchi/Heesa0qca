You can use the following Webhooks via the Figma API:

## POST webhook[​](#webhooks-v2-post-endpoint "Direct link to POST webhook")

Create a new webhook which will call the specified endpoint when the event triggers. By default, this webhook will automatically send a `PING` event to the endpoint when it is created. If this behavior is not desired, you can create the webhook and set the status to `PAUSED` and reactivate it later.
