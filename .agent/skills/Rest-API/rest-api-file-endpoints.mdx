# File endpoints

File endpoints let you fetch JSON and image representations of Figma files and specific nodes.[page:8] With a file key, you can query file structure, render images, and access related metadata.[page:8]

## Common patterns

Typical file‑related operations include:[page:8]

- Getting the full file JSON tree.  
- Fetching node subsets by ID.  
- Rendering images for nodes in various formats and scales.  
- Accessing file versions and version history.  
- Fetching Dev Mode and documentation‑related metadata.[page:8]

Each endpoint uses the standard base URL, takes a file key, and may accept query parameters such as node IDs, geometry settings, or image formats.[page:8] Rate‑limit tiers and required scopes vary per endpoint and are listed alongside each endpoint in the full docs.[page:8]
