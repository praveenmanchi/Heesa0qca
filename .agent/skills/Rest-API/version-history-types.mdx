On this page

Figma allows you to distinguish different stages or **Versions** of a file, as the file evolves over time. This is all recorded in the **Version history**, which allows users to view, track and restore previous versions of a file.

warning

**IMPORTANT:** The order of versions returned by GET file versions has changed. Versions are now ordered explicitly by when they were created. As a part of this change, the URL format for next\_page and prev\_page has also changed.

For more information, see the [changelog](/docs/rest-api/changelog/).

## Types[​](#types "Direct link to Types")

Figma will record some basic information about the file, like the who and when, as well as allow the user to determine a title and description for the version. These form the basis of the properties associated with version history.
