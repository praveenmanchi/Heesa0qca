The GET discovery endpoint allows you to retrieve text events that have occurred in Figma files throughout your organization. You can specify a start date and an end date to determine the time range for which you want to retrieve text events. The API returns links to JSON files containing the text events, organized by hour. Each link is valid for a specified duration, which you can set in your request.

## GET text events[​](#get-discovery-text-events "Direct link to GET text events")

Fetch up to 24 hours of text events for Figma files in your organization.
