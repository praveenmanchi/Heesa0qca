This section outlines the common error codes and resolutions you may encounter while using the Figma API.

Error code

Description

### 400[​](#400 "Direct link to 400")

Bad request

Parameters are invalid or malformed. Please check the input formats. This error can also happen if the requested resources are too large to complete the request, which results in a timeout. Please reduce the number and size of objects requested.

### 403[​](#403 "Direct link to 403")

Forbidden

The request was valid, but the server is refusing action. This can happen if the caller does not have the necessary permissions, or when making HTTP requests instead of HTTPS requests.

### 404[​](#404 "Direct link to 404")

Not found

The requested file or resource was not found.

### 429[​](#429 "Direct link to 429")

Rate limit

In some cases API requests may be throttled or rate limited. Please wait a while before attempting the request again (typically a minute). Rate limiting is calculated on a per-user basis. If the caller is using an OAuth token, the rate limit is calculated based on the user associated with the token.

### 500[​](#500 "Direct link to 500")

Internal server error

This most commonly occurs for very large image render requests, which may time out our server and return a 500. Please reduce the number and size of objects requested.
