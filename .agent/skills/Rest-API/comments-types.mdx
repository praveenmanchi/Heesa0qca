Figma’s Commenting mode allows users to leave comments directly on layers or objects on the canvas. This is useful for collaboration when you want to suggest an adjustment, provide feedback, or critique a specific object or layout. You can use the Figma API to access a whole host of information about a comment, from when the comment was made and by whom, to its exact location on the canvas.

## Commenting types[​](#commenting-types "Direct link to Commenting types")

There are a number of different properties associated with a comment and comment reactions, that help to give us more context. The following contains all of the properties comments and their reactions will have:
