### FILE\_COMMENT[​](#file-comment-event "Direct link to FILE_COMMENT")

Triggers whenever a user comments on a file.

This webhook could integrate with Asana or Jira and automatically create tasks whenever a user comments. It could also integrate with Slack and notify mentioned users.

The contents of a comment is returned in an array of [CommentFragment](/docs/rest-api/webhooks-types/#commentfragment-type). A `CommentFragment` either contains a text or mention field. A text field contains raw comment text with formatting derivatives, newlines will be encoded as `\n`, etc.

Text fields can also contain emojis, which are always encoded as a separate fragment and are surrounded by two `:` characters. Mention fields occur if a user types `@OtherUser` in their comment. A mention contains the user id of the mentioned user. All mentioned users are added to the mentioned array field, where additional user information is included.
